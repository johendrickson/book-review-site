          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            It’s easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed
            to write great Ruby code, you must go beyond syntax and absorb the
            Ruby way of thinking and problem solving. In <em>Eloquent Ruby</em>,
            Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do so you can
            leverage its immense, surprising power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture
            and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the “Ah
            Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way
            it does, and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance
            and expressiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Eloquent Ruby</em> starts small, answering tactical questions
            focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You’ll learn
            how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#);
            why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings,
            expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good
            for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building
            methods and classes. You’ll discover why Ruby classes contain so
            many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to
            avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own
            code—and why you’ll want to. He concludes with powerful
            project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain
            Specific Languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            A part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series,
            <em>Eloquent Ruby</em> will help you put on your Ruby-colored
            glasses and get results that make you a true believer.

            <h4>The first Ruby book I read in full within 24 hours</h4>
            <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Peter Cooper</p>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 26, 2011</p>
            <p>
              This book is so easy to read yet so useful and informative that I
              read it in its entirety within 24 hours (across 2 distinct days
              admittedly ;-)).
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Eloquent Ruby</em> is a book published by Addison Wesley and
              written by Russ Olsen (who also wrote
              <em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em> a few years ago). It clocks in at
              around 400 pages and has 31 chapters clocking in at around a
              punchy 10 pages each. Each chapter is titled as a guideline you
              should follow to write “eloquent” Ruby—things like “Create Classes
              That Understand Equality” and “Write Code That Looks Like
              Ruby”—and typically the claim is explained, some code examples
              shown and discussed, some real-world examples pointed to, and
              that’s it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with <em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em>, Russ adopts a chatty,
              familiar tone. Reading this book is like reading a book
              specifically written for you by a friend. He doesn’t shoot off on
              many unnecessary tangents and he keeps the stories short and
              sweet—but this book certainly couldn’t be called dry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The book is also notably short of egregious errors or omissions...
              I can only bring to mind a few spacing and formatting issues and
              only one true “error”: a <code>&gt;</code> instead of a
              <code>&lt;</code> in a class definition on a single example.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone except those who,
              well, could have written a similar book themselves... This book is
              a must-read if you’re not confident with Ruby idioms and the best
              way to structure and lay out your code—Russ’s approaches reinforce
              the current “standard” way to write Ruby and this alone is worth
              the price of admission.

            <h4>Eloquent Olsen</h4>
            <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Fogus</p>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 7, 2011</p>
            <p>
              For better or worse the vast majority of my work life journey has
              been travelled with Java as my vehicle of expression. However, by
              nature I have a burning desire to learn new languages and at one
              point or another I discovered Russ Olsen’s (also the author of
              <em>Eloquent Ruby</em>) <em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I absolutely loved <em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em> for reasons
              that I was not expecting... what I found was an extremely
              interesting book that was playful and as a nice side-effect
              <strong
                >actually taught me how Ruby’s powerful features make many
                design patterns unnecessary</strong
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Eloquent Ruby</em> is written for the programmer like me:
              someone with previous programming experience, but with only a
              passing understanding of Ruby itself. The structure of the book
              will help guide the Ruby neophyte toward a stronger understanding
              of not only the language constructs and idioms, but also the Ruby
              culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a proponent of the Lisp family of languages, I tend to look
              askance at languages falling into the ALGOL family, but
              <em>Eloquent Ruby</em> has succeeded in convincing me that with
              the right approach and mindset, Ruby can be a stunningly beautiful
              language. And this is really the key point to take away from Mr.
              Olsen’s book.
            </p>
            <p>
              The highlight of the book is of course its dénouement that
              succeeds in pulling together all of the lessons presented
              throughout the book into explaining the role that Domain-Specific
              Languages (DSL) serve in solving programming problems with Ruby...
              <em>Eloquent Ruby</em> makes a compelling case indeed.
